Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable Opponent) This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human plays against an AI agent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to always play optimally, making it impossible to beat.

Perfect for learning about game theory, search algorithms, and how AI can be used in turn-based games.

🧠 Key Features Human vs AI gameplay

AI uses the Minimax algorithm (optionally extendable to Alpha-Beta pruning)

Always plays the optimal move

Fully text-based interface in the terminal

Easy to understand and modify

🚀 Getting Started Prerequisites Python 3.x

Running the Game Clone the repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git cd tic-tac-toe-ai Run the game:

bash Copy Edit python tic_tac_toe_ai.py Play the game in the terminal!

🎮 Gameplay Instructions The board is a 3x3 grid.

You play as X, and the AI plays as O.

Input your move by entering the row and column numbers (0-based index).

The AI will respond after your turn.

Example:

markdown Copy Edit Current board: | |
| |
| |

Enter your move (row and column): 0 0 🗂 Project Structure bash Copy Edit 📁 tic-tac-toe-ai/ ├── tic_tac_toe_ai.py # Main Python script with game logic and AI └── README.md # Project documentation 💡 What You'll Learn How to implement turn-based games in Python

The logic behind unbeatable AI using Minimax

Understanding recursion and evaluation functions in game states

✨ Future Improvements Add GUI using tkinter or Pygame

Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficiency
